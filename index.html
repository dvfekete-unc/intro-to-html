    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey!  This is Dominic.  This is the part where I tell you stuff about me.</p>
    <p><b>Bold</b></p>
    <p><i>Italic</i></p>

    <h2>Facts about me</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I'd love to live in the Pacific northwest.  Somewhere in Oregon, Washington, or even British Columbia.  Though that might change if these fires keep up.</li>
        <li>I'm really not sure what I wanna do.  Most likely it'll involve multimedia design, or game design.  Honestly I'm just hoping to be pretty well-rounded overall.</li>
        <li>I moved from California to North Carolina when I was 11.  The humid here actually just murders me every summer but at least it's affordable to live here and doesn't catch fire constantly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Classes I am Currently Taking</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ARTS 353</li>
        <li>COMM 638</li>
        <li>COMP 126</li>
        <li>MEJO 187</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I enjoy drawing on my tablet and playing video games.  I don't really have a specific favorite game right now, but I have been playing a lot of the older Pokémon games recently during this pandemic (my favorite Pokémon are <a href="https://youtu.be/buc64u6Q_oA">Wooper and Quagsire</a>).</p>
